**What You Can Do:**
- **Start the Game:** Dive into the quiz by choosing 'S' from the main menu. You'll be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions where you get to pick the right answers.

**Gameplay:**
- The quiz is loaded with diverse questions, each offering four possible answers (A, B, C, D). Your job? Simply choose the correct answer.
- The program ensures that you won't encounter the same question twice during your game.
- After successfully answering five questions, your score is meticulously calculated. It's based on the number of questions you got right and the time you took to answer them.
- You'll receive prompt feedback after each question, letting you know whether your answer was spot on or not.
- At the end, your score is revealed along with a fitting message, so you know how well you did.

**Special Features:**
- The code artfully employs if-else statements and switch cases to handle menu options and question selection.
- To keep things exciting, a random number generator ensures that every quiz session offers fresh questions.
- You can even etch your name into the hall of fame with the highest scores saved in a "score.txt" file.

**Note:**
- While the code is set up for an enriching experience, it's worth noting that some functions and code segments, like 'conio.h' and 'dos.h,' are more tailored to older computer systems. On modern machines, you might need to make a few adjustments for a seamless experience.

This C Quiz App is your gateway to boosting your general knowledge in a way that's both entertaining and educational. It's a perfect choice for those who want to have fun while challenging their wits.
